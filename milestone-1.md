        <h2>Application Idea</h2>
        The main idea for my application is to help students with one of the most challenging concepts(at least for me) to grasp in Mathematics. The line equation. My idea is to use html css tools to create a enviroment where learners can interact with the graph and the line on it to understannd how 2 points on the graph make a line and determine the slope or how the slope make a line with one given point. I will try and apply all the concepts learnt in the course till now as well as the future topics mainly relating to interaction with the database.
